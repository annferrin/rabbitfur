# rabbitfur
Rabbitfur's personal repository
### Why the name?
Rabbitfur is often how I refer to my 18+ year old cat's fur, as it's soft and very squishable. So why not use it as a username?
### Exploring some new learning
I have _some_ experience with development, but have mostly watched it being done by others on my team. I figure it doesn't hurt!
